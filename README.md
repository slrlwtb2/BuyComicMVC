This project aimed to expand my knowledge of ASP.NET Core MVC and its key components. Throughout the process, I focused on several areas, including understanding MVC architecture, utilizing scaffolding features, differentiating between ASP.NET API and ASP.NET MVC, deploying a database and website using Azure, and improving my backend skills through working with controllers.

In the process, I learned to pick between ASP.NET API and ASP.NET MVC. While MVC is for form-based web applications, APIâ€™s are designed to provide data and services for other applications. Understanding this difference, it helped me choose the suited approach for different cases.



So, in a nutshell, this project was all about me learning ASP.NET Core MVC. I studied its architecture, made use of scaffolding, understood the difference between API and MVC, deployed stuff on Azure, and I'm quite enjoying all the new skills I've gained!
